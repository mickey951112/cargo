//! A `Source` for registry-based packages.
//!
//! # What's a Registry?
//!
//! Registries are central locations where packages can be uploaded to,
//! discovered, and searched for. The purpose of a registry is to have a
//! location that serves as permanent storage for versions of a crate over time.
//!
//! Compared to git sources, a registry provides many packages as well as many
//! versions simultaneously. Git sources can also have commits deleted through
//! rebasings where registries cannot have their versions deleted.
//!
//! # The Index of a Registry
//!
//! One of the major difficulties with a registry is that hosting so many
//! packages may quickly run into performance problems when dealing with
//! dependency graphs. It's infeasible for cargo to download the entire contents
//! of the registry just to resolve one package's dependencies, for example. As
//! a result, cargo needs some efficient method of querying what packages are
//! available on a registry, what versions are available, and what the
//! dependencies for each version is.
//!
//! One method of doing so would be having the registry expose an HTTP endpoint
//! which can be queried with a list of packages and a response of their
//! dependencies and versions is returned. This is somewhat inefficient however
//! as we may have to hit the endpoint many times and we may have already
//! queried for much of the data locally already (for other packages, for
//! example). This also involves inventing a transport format between the
//! registry and Cargo itself, so this route was not taken.
//!
//! Instead, Cargo communicates with registries through a git repository
//! referred to as the Index. The Index of a registry is essentially an easily
//! query-able version of the registry's database for a list of versions of a
//! package as well as a list of dependencies for each version.
//!
//! Using git to host this index provides a number of benefits:
//!
//! * The entire index can be stored efficiently locally on disk. This means
//!   that all queries of a registry can happen locally and don't need to touch
//!   the network.
//!
//! * Updates of the index are quite efficient. Using git buys incremental
//!   updates, compressed transmission, etc for free. The index must be updated
//!   each time we need fresh information from a registry, but this is one
//!   update of a git repository that probably hasn't changed a whole lot so
//!   it shouldn't be too expensive.
//!
//!   Additionally, each modification to the index is just appending a line at
//!   the end of a file (the exact format is described later). This means that
//!   the commits for an index are quite small and easily applied/compressable.
//!
//! ## The format of the Index
//!
//! The index is a store for the list of versions for all packages known, so its
//! format on disk is optimized slightly to ensure that `ls registry` doesn't
//! produce a list of all packages ever known. The index also wants to ensure
//! that there's not a million files which may actually end up hitting
//! filesystem limits at some point. To this end, a few decisions were made
//! about the format of the registry:
//!
//! 1. Each crate will have one file corresponding to it. Each version for a
//!    crate will just be a line in this file.
//! 2. There will be two tiers of directories for crate names, under which
//!    crates corresponding to those tiers will be located.
//!
//! As an example, this is an example hierarchy of an index:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! .
//! ├── 3
//! │   └── u
//! │       └── url
//! ├── bz
//! │   └── ip
//! │       └── bzip2
//! ├── config.json
//! ├── en
//! │   └── co
//! │       └── encoding
//! └── li
//!     ├── bg
//!     │   └── libgit2
//!     └── nk
//!         └── link-config
//! ```
//!
//! The root of the index contains a `config.json` file with a few entries
//! corresponding to the registry (see `RegistryConfig` below).
//!
//! Otherwise, there are three numbered directories (1, 2, 3) for crates with
//! names 1, 2, and 3 characters in length. The 1/2 directories simply have the
//! crate files underneath them, while the 3 directory is sharded by the first
//! letter of the crate name.
//!
//! Otherwise the top-level directory contains many two-letter directory names,
//! each of which has many sub-folders with two letters. At the end of all these
//! are the actual crate files themselves.
//!
//! The purpose of this layout is to hopefully cut down on `ls` sizes as well as
//! efficient lookup based on the crate name itself.
//!
//! ## Crate files
//!
//! Each file in the index is the history of one crate over time. Each line in
//! the file corresponds to one version of a crate, stored in JSON format (see
//! the `RegistryPackage` structure below).
//!
//! As new versions are published, new lines are appended to this file. The only
//! modifications to this file that should happen over time are yanks of a
//! particular version.
//!
//! # Downloading Packages
//!
//! The purpose of the Index was to provide an efficient method to resolve the
//! dependency graph for a package. So far we only required one network
//! interaction to update the registry's repository (yay!). After resolution has
//! been performed, however we need to download the contents of packages so we
//! can read the full manifest and build the source code.
//!
//! To accomplish this, this source's `download` method will make an HTTP
//! request per-package requested to download tarballs into a local cache. These
//! tarballs will then be unpacked into a destination folder.
//!
//! Note that because versions uploaded to the registry are frozen forever that
//! the HTTP download and unpacking can all be skipped if the version has
//! already been downloaded and unpacked. This caching allows us to only
//! download a package when absolutely necessary.
//!
//! # Filesystem Hierarchy
//!
//! Overall, the `$HOME/.cargo` looks like this when talking about the registry:
//!
//! ```notrust
//! # A folder under which all registry metadata is hosted (similar to
//! # $HOME/.cargo/git)
//! $HOME/.cargo/registry/
//!
//!     # For each registry that cargo knows about (keyed by hostname + hash)
//!     # there is a folder which is the checked out version of the index for
//!     # the registry in this location. Note that this is done so cargo can
//!     # support multiple registries simultaneously
//!     index/
//!         registry1-<hash>/
//!         registry2-<hash>/
//!         ...
//!
//!     # This folder is a cache for all downloaded tarballs from a registry.
//!     # Once downloaded and verified, a tarball never changes.
//!     cache/
//!         registry1-<hash>/<pkg>-<version>.crate
//!         ...
//!
//!     # Location in which all tarballs are unpacked. Each tarball is known to
//!     # be frozen after downloading, so transitively this folder is also
//!     # frozen once its unpacked (it's never unpacked again)
//!     src/
//!         registry1-<hash>/<pkg>-<version>/...
//!         ...
//! ```
