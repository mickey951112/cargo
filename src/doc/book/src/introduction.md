# The Cargo Manual

![Cargo Logo](images/Cargo-Logo-Small.png)

Cargo is the [Rust] *package manager*. Cargo downloads your Rust projectâ€™s
dependencies, compiles your project, makes packages, and upload them to
[crates.io], the Rust *package registry*.


## [Getting Started](getting-started.html)

To get started with Cargo, install Cargo (and Rust) and set up your first crate.
