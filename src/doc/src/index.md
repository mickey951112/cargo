# The Cargo Book

![Cargo Logo](images/Cargo-Logo-Small.png)

Cargo is the [Rust] *package manager*. Cargo downloads your Rust project’s
dependencies, compiles your project, makes packages, and upload them to
[crates.io], the Rust community’s *package registry*. You can contribute
to this book on [GitHub].
