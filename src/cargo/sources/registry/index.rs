//! Management of the index of a registry source
//!
//! This module contains management of the index and various operations, such as
//! actually parsing the index, looking for crates, etc. This is intended to be
//! abstract over remote indices (downloaded via git) and local registry indices
//! (which are all just present on the filesystem).
//!
//! ## Index Performance
//!
//! One important aspect of the index is that we want to optimize the "happy
//! path" as much as possible. Whenever you type `cargo build` Cargo will
//! *always* reparse the registry and learn about dependency information. This
//! is done because Cargo needs to learn about the upstream crates.io crates
//! that you're using and ensure that the preexisting `Cargo.lock` still matches
//! the current state of the world.
//!
//! Consequently, Cargo "null builds" (the index that Cargo adds to each build
//! itself) need to be fast when accessing the index. The primary performance
//! optimization here is to avoid parsing JSON blobs from the registry if we
//! don't need them. Most secondary optimizations are centered around removing
//! allocations and such, but avoiding parsing JSON is the #1 optimization.
//!
//! When we get queries from the resolver we're given a `Dependency`. This
//! dependency in turn has a version requirement, and with lock files that
//! already exist these version requirements are exact version requirements
//! `=a.b.c`. This means that we in theory only need to parse one line of JSON
//! per query in the registry, the one that matches version `a.b.c`.
//!
//! The crates.io index, however, is not amenable to this form of query. Instead
//! the crates.io index simply is a file where each line is a JSON blob. To
//! learn about the versions in each JSON blob we would need to parse the JSON,
//! defeating the purpose of trying to parse as little as possible.
//!
//! > Note that as a small aside even *loading* the JSON from the registry is
//! > actually pretty slow. For crates.io and remote registries we don't
//! > actually check out the git index on disk because that takes quite some
//! > time and is quite large. Instead we use `libgit2` to read the JSON from
//! > the raw git objects. This in turn can be slow (aka show up high in
//! > profiles) because libgit2 has to do deflate decompression and such.
//!
//! To solve all these issues a strategy is employed here where Cargo basically
//! creates an index into the index. The first time a package is queried about
//! (first time being for an entire computer) Cargo will load the contents
//! (slowly via libgit2) from the registry. It will then (slowly) parse every
//! single line to learn about its versions. Afterwards, however, Cargo will
//! emit a new file (a cache) which is amenable for speedily parsing in future
//! invocations.
//!
//! This cache file is currently organized by basically having the semver
//! version extracted from each JSON blob. That way Cargo can quickly and easily
//! parse all versions contained and which JSON blob they're associated with.
//! The JSON blob then doesn't actually need to get parsed unless the version is
//! parsed.
//!
//! Altogether the initial measurements of this shows a massive improvement for
//! Cargo null build performance. It's expected that the improvements earned
//! here will continue to grow over time in the sense that the previous
//! implementation (parse all lines each time) actually continues to slow down
//! over time as new versions of a crate are published. In any case when first
//! implemented a null build of Cargo itself would parse 3700 JSON blobs from
//! the registry and load 150 blobs from git. Afterwards it parses 150 JSON
//! blobs and loads 0 files git. Removing 200ms or more from Cargo's startup
//! time is certainly nothing to sneeze at!
//!
//! Note that this is just a high-level overview, there's of course lots of
//! details like invalidating caches and whatnot which are handled below, but
//! hopefully those are more obvious inline in the code itself.

// Implementation of serializing/deserializing the cache of summaries on disk.
// Currently the format looks like:
//
// +--------------------+----------------------+-------------+---+
// | cache version byte | index format version | git sha rev | 0 |
// +--------------------+----------------------+-------------+---+
//
// followed by...
//
// +----------------+---+------------+---+
// | semver version | 0 |  JSON blob | 0 | ...
// +----------------+---+------------+---+
//
// The idea is that this is a very easy file for Cargo to parse in future
// invocations. The read from disk should be quite fast and then afterwards all
// we need to know is what versions correspond to which JSON blob.
//
// The leading version byte is intended to ensure that there's some level of
// future compatibility against changes to this cache format so if different
// versions of Cargo share the same cache they don't get too confused. The git
// sha lets us know when the file needs to be regenerated (it needs regeneration
// whenever the index itself updates).
//
// Cache versions:
// * `1`: The original version.
// * `2`: Added the "index format version" field so that if the index format
//   changes, different versions of cargo won't get confused reading each
//   other's caches.
// * `3`: Bumped the version to work around a issue where multiple versions of
//   a package were published that differ only by semver metadata. For
//   example, openssl-src 110.0.0 and 110.0.0+1.1.0f. Previously, the cache
//   would be incorrectly populated with two entries, both 110.0.0. After
//   this, the metadata will be correctly included. This isn't really a format
//   change, just a version bump to clear the incorrect cache entries. Note:
//   the index shouldn't allow these, but unfortunately crates.io doesn't
//   check it.
