== PROFILES

Profiles may be used to configure compiler options such as optimization levels
and debug settings. See
linkcargo:reference/manifest.html#the-profile-sections[the reference]
for more details.

Profile selection depends on the target and crate being built. By default the
`dev` or `test` profiles are used. If the `--release` flag is given, then the
`release` or `bench` profiles are used.

Dependencies use the `dev`/`release` profiles.
