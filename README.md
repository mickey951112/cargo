Cargo downloads your Rust projectâ€™s dependencies and compiles your project.

## Compiling cargo

You'll want to clone cargo using --recursive on git, to clone in it's submodule
dependencies.
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo
```
or
```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```
Then it's as simple as ```make``` followed by ```make install``` and you're
ready to go.
