Cargo downloads your Rust projectâ€™s dependencies and compiles your project.

## Installing Cargo

Cargo is distributed by default with Rust, so if you've got `rustc` installed
locally you probably also have `cargo` installed locally.

If, however, you would like to install Cargo from the nightly binaries that are
generated, you may also do so! Note that these nightlies are not official
binaries, so they are only provided in one format with one installation method.
Each tarball below contains a top-level `install.sh` script to install Cargo.

* [`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`](https://static.rust-lang.org/cargo-dist/cargo-nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz)
* [`i686-unknown-linux-gnu`](https://static.rust-lang.org/cargo-dist/cargo-nightly-i686-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz)
* [`x86_64-apple-darwin`](https://static.rust-lang.org/cargo-dist/cargo-nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz)
* [`i686-apple-darwin`](https://static.rust-lang.org/cargo-dist/cargo-nightly-i686-apple-darwin.tar.gz)
* [`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`](https://static.rust-lang.org/cargo-dist/cargo-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.tar.gz)
* [`i686-pc-windows-gnu`](https://static.rust-lang.org/cargo-dist/cargo-nightly-i686-pc-windows-gnu.tar.gz)
* [`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`](https://static.rust-lang.org/cargo-dist/cargo-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.gz)

Note that if you're on Windows you will have to run the `install.sh` script from
inside an MSYS shell, likely from a MinGW-64 installation.

## Compiling from Source

Cargo requires the following tools and packages to build:

* `rustc`
* `python`
* `curl` (on Unix)
* `cmake`
* OpenSSL headers (only for Unix, this is the `libssl-dev` package on ubuntu)

Cargo can then be compiled like many other standard unix-like projects:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo
cd cargo
python src/etc/install-deps.py
./configure --local-rust-root="$PWD"/rustc
make
make install
```

More options can be discovered through `./configure`, such as compiling cargo
for more than one target. For example, if you'd like to compile both 32 and 64
bit versions of cargo on unix you would use:

```
$ ./configure --target=i686-unknown-linux-gnu,x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

## Adding new subcommands to Cargo

Cargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
Cargo itself. See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and
a list of known community-developed subcommands.

To contribute to the docs, all you need to do is change the markdown files in
the `src/doc` directory.
