    // new minimum version required for `log`. Now this isn't always guaranteed
    // to work. What'll happen here is we *won't* lock the `log` dependency nor
    // the `log` crate itself, but we will inform the registry "please prefer
    // this version of `log`". That way if our newer version of serde works with

    // the versions of the package change as well. If this ends up happening
    // then we want to make sure we don't lock a package ID node that doesn't
    // actually exist. Note that we don't do transitive visits of all the

    // have been updated to have an updated version requirement on `serde`. In
    // this case both `keep(serde)` and `keep(log)` return `true` (the `keep`
    // that's an argument to this function). We, however, don't want to keep
    // either of those! Otherwise we'll get obscure resolve errors about locked
    // versions.
    //
    // To solve this problem we iterate over all packages with path sources
    // (aka ones with manifests that are changing) and take a look at all of
    // their dependencies. If any dependency does not match something in the
    // previous lock file, then we're guaranteed that the main resolver will
    // update the source of this dependency no matter what. Knowing this we
    // poison all packages from the same source, forcing them all to get
    // updated.
    //
    // This may seem like a heavy hammer, and it is! It means that if you change
    // anything from crates.io then all of crates.io becomes unlocked. Note,
    // however, that we still want conservative updates. This currently happens
    // because the first candidate the resolver picks is the previously locked
    // version, and only if that fails to activate to we move on and try
    // a different version. (giving the guise of conservative updates)
    //
    // For example let's say we had `serde = "0.1"` written in our lock file.
    // When we later edit this to `serde = "0.1.3"` we don't want to lock serde
    // at its old version, 0.1.1. Instead we want to allow it to update to
    // `0.1.3` and update its own dependencies (like above). To do this *all
    // crates from crates.io* are not locked (aka added to `avoid_locking`).
    // For dependencies like `log` their previous version in the lock file will
    // come up first before newer version, if newer version are available.
