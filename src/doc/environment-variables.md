% Environment Variables

Cargo sets a number of environment variables which your code can detect. To get
the value of any of these variables in a Rust program, do this:

```
let version = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")
```

`version` will now contain the value of `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`.

Here are a list of the variables Cargo sets, organized by when it sets them:

# Environment variables Cargo reads

* `CARGO_HOME` - Cargo maintains a local cache of the registry index and of git
  checkouts of crates.  By default these are stored under `$HOME/.cargo`, but
  this variable overrides the location of this directory.
* `CARGO_PROFILE` - If this is set to a positive integer *N*, Cargo will record
  timing data as it runs.  When it exits, it will print this data as a profile
  *N* levels deep.
* `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` - Location of where to place all generated artifacts,
  relative to the current working directory.
* `RUSTC` - Instead of running `rustc`, Cargo will execute this specified
  compiler instead.
* `RUSTDOC` - Instead of running `rustdoc`, Cargo will execute this specified
  `rustdoc` instance instead.

# Environment variables Cargo sets for build scripts

* `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` - The directory containing the manifest for the package
                         being built (the package containing the build
                         script). Also note that this is the value of the
                         current working directory of the build script when it
                         starts.
* `CARGO_FEATURE_<name>` - For each activated feature of the package being
                           built, this environment variable will be present
                           where `<name>` is the name of the feature uppercased
                           and having `-` translated to `_`.
* `OUT_DIR` - the folder in which all output should be placed. This folder is
              inside the build directory for the package being built, and it is
              unique for the package in question.
* `TARGET` - the target triple that is being compiled for. Native code should be
             compiled for this triple. Some more information about target
             triples can be found in [clangâ€™s own documentation][clang].
* `HOST` - the host triple of the rust compiler.
* `NUM_JOBS` - the parallelism specified as the top-level parallelism. This can
               be useful to pass a `-j` parameter to a system like `make`.
* `OPT_LEVEL`, `DEBUG` - values of the corresponding variables for the
                         profile currently being built.
* `PROFILE` - name of the profile currently being built (see
              [profiles][profile]).
* `DEP_<name>_<key>` - For more information about this set of environment
                       variables, see build script documentation about [`links`][links].
